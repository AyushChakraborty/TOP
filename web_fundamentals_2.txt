TCP/IP (transmission control protocol, internet protocol) define how data should travel across the 
internet

Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol that defines how clients and servers
should interact with each other across the internet, but the eventual transfer is guided using
TCP/IP protocols 

a website is made of 2 types of files, code files which have the html, css, js codes and
asset files which have the images, audio etc that are displayed on the webpages

so when we enter a web address onto a browser, it first connects to the DNS server to find
the IP address corresponding to the address given, then an HTTP request is sent through the internet
to the corresponding server asking it to send a copy of the webpage to the client, if all goes well
the server sends a "200 OK" message to the client indicating that the page can be viewed then
the server starts sending packets to the client across different efficient paths, which is
reconstructed back by the browser which also shows it to the user 

when reconstructing the html files specifically the browser first starts parsing the html code
then when it encounters <link> it sends a request to the server again to send the css file that 
is mentioned by <link> and when it encounters <script> it again sends a request to the server for
the same

the browser then generates an in-memory DOM tree from the parsed HTML, an in-memory CSSOM tree 
from the parsed CSS, then compiles and executes JS 

structure of domain names: label.TLD where TLD is top level domain
TLDs tell us about the general purpose of the domain, like com, gov, edu, us, org 
labels closer to the left are lower heirarchially and those to the right are at the top
so, developer.mozilla.org has "developer" as subdomain, "mozilla" is the domain and "org"
is TLD

domain names need to be brought and the renewal has higher priority than new applications for payment

"whois" command can be used in the terminal to find if a domain name is in use and get some info
about it: whois mozilla.org

now the DNS server is NOT just ONE server but has many servers namely: Resolving name server, 
root name server, TLD name server , authoritative name server. After a domain name is passed 
through all this do we get the corresponding IP address which is then fed through to internet
to that respective server, what happens in a DNS server is:
    when www.example.com. (. at end is needed for the process to begin, altough its implicit)
    is typed in the browser, the browser asks the OS which in turn asks the RNS if it has 
    it stored in the DNS cache, if yes, it just returns it, else the RNS asks the TLDNS which
    inturn asks the ANS and finally returns the IP address to the OS, in each step of the way, the RNS 
    updates its cache. The OS then returns the IP address to the browser and it makes the connection
    to it
