think of the internet as "wires" buried under the oceans, "dishes" which transmit and recieve
wireless signals. Servers are special computers directly connected to those wires and webpages
are files on those server's hardrive

There might be a specific server for google.com and one for dunkindonuts.com (which are 
domain names) and so on, and each of those servers have a specific IP address or internet protocol address

The computers we use at home is NOT a server since its not connected directly to the internet
or the "wires", they are instead called clients and are connected to the internet through 
Internet Service Providers(ISP)

information sent across internet is sent as packets and they are reassembeled back at their
destination

everything has an IP address, and routers help direct packets around the internet to wherever they
were intended to go. They are present whenever two or more parts of the internet intersect, we
have a router

To ensure that a packet goes to its intended server from a client computer the following happens:
    - initially the packet is only wrapped in the IP address of the client, then as it travels
    it encounters the first router which wraps the packet in its IP address, then it encounters one
    more which wraps it further in its IP and so on till it reaches the intended server
When a packet is sent to the client, it is wrapped in all of its prev wrappings and unravelled
one by one as it passes through different routers to eventually reach the client 

to access the internet, we always use the DN(domain name) instead of the harder to 
remember IPA

a mapping which maps all the IPA to domain names is a DNS which is a phonebook for the internet 

all this information is stored in the DNS server which is maintained by ISPs

so when a DN in entered by a user on the client it connects to the DNS server to get the 
corresponding IPA and then it is sent to that particular server which is identified by the IPA 
then the server sends information to the client through the internet acorss various routers in from
of packets 

now since the telephone network already exists in a pretty wide form, we make use of this to 
connect more houses and areas to the internet. This is done by using MODEMs which convert
info from network to info mangable by the telephone system and vice versa, but we can also have
plain optical fibres for connections between servers and computers in which case MODEMs are not
needed

now to access a specific webpage or website within a server, we make use of the URL or universal
resource locator

when we type the domain name, we get the website of that particular domain displayed in the
web browser

now keep in mind that a web server can host multiple websites at the same server, hence a 
webserver is never used to designate a website

a web browser is a piece of software that helps retreive and display web pages and
a search engine is a WEBSITE that helps people find web pages from other websites 
so when a web browser opens up for the first time, the defualt website it opens to is the 
search engine.

when a client requests for a webpage to be dispayed from the server then a copy of the 
page is downloaded from the server onto the client machine to be displayed on the browser, after
this is done, the browser stores DNS CACHE for that page so that when its to be accessed again later,
it will just use this cache instead of downloading the page locally to be displayed on the browser
again
