(for unix)
shell is a program where users can type commands to let the computer do something. The most 
popular unix shell is bash(bourne again SHell)

/ is the topmost directory, so /Users means that Users dir is under / dir (only true for this, all
other /s refer to change from top to bottom dir, for egs /Users/Foo means that Foo dir is under
Users dir)

ls is used to see whats in the current dir, ls -F is used for the same but gives a more comprehensible
output, where 
    / indicates that its a dir
    * indicates that its an executable
    @ indicates that its a link

links are pointers to another folder or file, there are two types of links, hard and soft(symbolic)
hard links are where deleting the target file does not delete the reference and they can be 
created only within the same filespace: ln target_file link_name
soft links are where deleting the target causes the link to be broken and the link cannot point
to the location of the file which existed: ln -s target_file link_name

echo "hello" > hello.txt: is used to write hello to a new file called hello.txt
car hello.txt: gives hello, outputs the text within the file 

"man" gives us help regarding some command: man ls

ls -l gives a longer version of ls output and ls -h is the short version, ls -t arranges the content
in based on what was changed first

ls [argument] gives the content of some other directory given in [argument]

ls -s gives the size of all the files only(dirs shown as 0)

ls -S sorts the dirs based on size

cd .. takes us one level up the directory tree, and cd ../.. takes you two levels back for egs

ls -F -a gives the detailed lists of directories, links, executables and also the hidden directories
like ., .. where . refers to itself, .. refers to the directory right above it, hence saying 
cd .. when within a directory is the same as saying cd [directory one level up]
the -a flag stands for "show all"

just typing cd/ cd ~ takes us to the home directory 

cd - takes you back to the prev working directory

cd / takes you to the / directory

the general format of unix commands are:
    $ command [option] [argument]

where $ is the prompt, option is the behaviour definer of the command and argument is where the
command acts on. An option without an argument is known as a flag, and option and argument 
together is known as parameter

-p option is used with mkdir when we need to create a parent directory to store the child one
if it does not exist, for egs, 
    mkdir home/documents/foo will return no such file or directory error if home/documents does
    not exist, but, 
    mkdir -p home/documents/foo will create home/documents/foo even if it does not exist
