an SSH key is a secure identifier used to identify your machine, and its used to upload your rep
without having to enter UN and pass every time 

an SSH key for you machine can be created using 
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519

enter the pass if you want to for it

SSH uses assymetric encryption where a public and private key is generated for both of the users
sharing the message, the key is generated using RSA algo and these keys are mathematically linked

So what happens is that user 1 uses the public key of user 2 to encrypt the message and then
user 2 uses his private key to decrypt it, the same goes other way around too. Just that initially
both users must exhange their public keys

git is nothing but a version control system, there are local, centralised and distributed VCS
where git is a DVCS as any developer has a full copy of the file system and any developer can 
merge his file system into the main branch.
