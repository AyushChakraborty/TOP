mongoDB is a database which does not use any set schema, that is, data is not stored in row column
fashion, but in a json file with hierarcies present in it 


to install it first 
    brew install mongo-community@8.0

to install the latest mongoDB server code, this will install an executable, which has to
code to start the local mongoDB server

now to operate the server, we need a client and that is the mongosh client, which can be installed
using 
    brew install mongosh

and now to open mongoDB server each time, we can write the command
    mongod --config /opt/homebrew/etc/mongod.conf

(these are all local to my machine)

to let the server open each time the system boots, write
    brew services start mongodb/brew/mongodb-community@8.0

(but lets just start the server manually each time)

then, letting the server run, we open another terminal window, and type in  
    mongosh

to start the mongosh client which directly interacts with the local server which has 
a local address of
    mongodb://localhost:27017

then install mongo compass which is a visual representation of whats happening in the
server and what and how many databases are running in the server

to connect the server to compass, just add the local address of the server to it, and everything
is set
