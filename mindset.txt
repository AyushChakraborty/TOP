When learning, two modes are involved: focus and diffuse mode. Foucs mode happens when you are
actively learning and trying to focus whereas diffuse mode is when the brain is not learning
directly but makes the connections subconsciously such as when doing dishes

when stuck in something, make sure to know the specifics then take a break and let the brain
do the handle the connections

it may take more or less time to learn a certain concept and its not an indication of 
intelligence but rather the types of experiences one has been exposed to resulting in certain
concepts being grapsed faster or slower by certain individuals, for egs a person with exposure
to logic flow from a child learns programming better in general as compared to someone who has
been epxosed to say only arts

no deadlines! take your time and learn

since the brain is a muscle, it performs better after a rest just like any other muscle, 
so step away when you want to grasp something better or get stuck anywhere

stick to the path laid out!

ONLY compare yourself to your past self

try your best to make digital notes, web dev requires that

start reading text documentations very slowly, if you feel your mind drift, slow down, 
come back to that word again and start

avoid rabbit holes as things often require other things to get a deep understanding of a topic

refactoring is changing the structure of the code to a more efficient one without changing the 
behaviour of the code

if the initial build flow of the code is fine, then during refactroring dont throw it out, 
instead tweak certain elements of the code to make the code behave the way you want it to

write your unit tests, it makes the code seem more professional
